					<Accordion.Header>WHAT IS A FAMILY DOCTOR?</Accordion.Header>
					<Accordion.Body>
						Family doctors are specialized in comprehensive healthcare for you and your family, starting from birth to the late stages of life. In most cases, family doctors can address 80-90% of all your medical issues and are also capable of treating chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. They spend time getting to know you and your medical history and provide continuity of care even in instances when they may have to refer you to a specialist. They also help to coordinate care with specialists so that you can trust you are in the best hands.
